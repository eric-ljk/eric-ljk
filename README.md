Hello and welcome! ðŸ‘‹ Here is a selection of my projects, where I tackle topics from data wrangling to Natural Language Processing (NLP). 

I have completed General Assembly's Data Science Immersive, where I covered the data science workflow and libraries with respect to Python, with applications of machine learning, probability/statistics, NLP, time series techniques, PCA, data engineering, Bayesian inference and Neural Networks. Below, I highlight some of the projects I've done: 

**Bipolar Disorder and Mood Stabilisers**

I applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyse the accounts of bipolar individuals regarding 3 mood stabilisers, and built a classifier that could discern between bipolar subtypes 1 and 2 with 72% accuracy.

**Cycosports Race Analysis**

I derived group-based and individualised insights from real-life trail running data. Races usually publish result tables, but what actionable insights can be derived from them? By crafting clear visualisations on age, gender and running clubs, several were revealed.
